<h2>Doing Our Bit</h2>
	<p>We'd all like the world to be a better, disease-free place. Unfortunately, it's a daunting task that most of us feel like there's nothing we can do about it as individuals.</p>
	<p>But there is something we can all do; use the spare computing power on machines of all types to run <a href="https://foldingathome.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding@home</a>. It's a program that will use that spare power to help find a cure from diseases including cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s and Huntington's.</p>
	<p>As well as feeling great about making the world a better place, it also allows us to be competitive with other <?=SITE_NAME?> members to fight up the <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/stats/team/<?=$folding['team']?>" target="_blank">team</a> ranks and pushing us all up the team leader boards.</p>
